# WeekGrid

`WeekGrid` renders a host-supplied five- or seven-day week with all-day spans, timed event geometry, overlap lanes, the current-time marker and an accessible low-level `CalendarGrid` surface.

## Usage

```tsx
import { WeekGrid } from "@gears-frontx/calendar-kit/week-grid";

<WeekGrid
  date={weekDate}
  events={events}
  visibleDays={5}
  interactionMode="quick-create"
  locale="en-US"
  timeZone={viewerTimeZone}
  direction="ltr"
  t={t}
  now={now}
  onQuickCreate={({ range, anchorRect }) => openCreate(range, anchorRect)}
  renderEvent={(context) => context.event.title}
/>;
```

## Props

<!-- generated:props WeekGridProps -->

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `date` | `CalendarDate` | yes | Any day in the week to show. The week starts on Monday. |
| `events` | `readonly CalendarEvent<Payload>[]` | yes | Events to lay out. Only the ones overlapping the visible week are drawn. |
| `cellClassName` | `string` |  | Class added to every day cell. |
| `className` | `string` |  | Class added to the component root. |
| `columnHeaderClassName` | `string` |  | Class added to every day header. |
| `defaultInteractionMode` | `WeekGridInteractionMode` |  | Initial interaction mode when uncontrolled. |
| `defaultSelectedEventId` | `string` |  | Initial selected event when uncontrolled. |
| `getCellState` | `(cell: CalendarCell) => CalendarCellState \| undefined` |  | Host state per cell. `unavailable` blocks the cell; it stays focusable. |
| `getEventFrameProps` | `(context: CalendarEventRenderContext<Payload>) => EventFrameHookProps \| undefined` |  | Class and `data-tone` for the event's card frame, so host CSS can mark a state such as a conflict or a busy block. No inline style: the kit keeps the focus outline out of reach. |
| `gutterClassName` | `string` |  | Class on every gutter label: hours, all-day, zone and the trailing copy. |
| `interactionMode` | `WeekGridInteractionMode` |  | Controlled interaction mode. Default `quick-create`. |
| `maxEventsPerSlot` | `number` |  | Most cards that start in one row of a day. Later ones hide behind a `+N` chip. Default: no cap. |
| `now` | `UtcInstant` |  | Reference instant for the now line and past styling. Default: the wall clock, per minute. |
| `onEventSelect` | `(event: CalendarEvent<Payload>, context: CalendarEventRenderContext<Payload>, anchor?: HT…` |  | An available event was activated; `anchor` is the card, for a detail popover. |
| `onInteractionModeChange` | `(mode: WeekGridInteractionMode) => void` |  | Called when the grid asks to change mode. |
| `onMoveRequest` | `(request: CalendarMoveRequest) => void` |  | An event was dropped on a new slot in `paint-and-move` mode. Call `confirm` or `cancel`. |
| `onOverflowSelect` | `(cell: CalendarCell, anchor: HTMLElement) => void` |  | The `+N` chip was activated. `anchor` is the chip, for a popover. |
| `onPaintSelect` | `(range: CalendarSelectionRange) => void` |  | A range was painted in `paint-and-move` mode. |
| `onQuickCreate` | `(payload: CalendarQuickCreatePayload) => void` |  | An empty slot was activated in `quick-create` mode. |
| `onResizeRequest` | `(request: CalendarResizeRequest) => void` |  | A resize handle on timed, single-day, movable events asks the host to move the event's end. |
| `onSelectedEventIdChange` | `(eventId: string \| null) => void` |  | Called when an event is selected or deselected. |
| `paintColorFamily` | `CalendarColorFamily` |  | Colour family of a painted range. Unset, the painted cells use the plain selection style. |
| `renderCell` | `(context: CalendarCellContext) => ReactNode` |  | Replaces the content of each empty time cell. |
| `renderConflict` | `CalendarConflictRenderer` |  | Replaces how each conflict renders inside the default card. |
| `renderDetail` | `CalendarDetailRenderer<Payload>` |  | Renders an inline detail for the selected event. Receives `close`. |
| `renderEvent` | `CalendarEventRenderer<Payload>` |  | Replaces the default `EventCard` for timed and all-day events. Renders inside a button, so the content must not be interactive. |
| `renderEventMetadata` | `CalendarEventRenderer<Payload>` |  | Replaces the metadata rows (location, organizer, type) of the default `EventCard`. |
| `renderHeader` | `(column: WeekGridHeaderColumn) => ReactNode` |  | Replaces the weekday and day number of each day header. The time column keeps its label. |
| `renderOverflow` | `(hiddenCount: number, cell: CalendarCell) => ReactNode` |  | Replaces the text of the `+N` chip. Receives the hidden count. |
| `renderTimeRange` | `(range: CalendarTimeRange<unknown>, context: { readonly geometry: CalendarEventGeometry; …` |  | Renders the content of each band in `timeRanges`. Without it no band is drawn. |
| `renderUnavailable` | `(cell: CalendarCell) => ReactNode` |  | Drawn in cells covered by an unavailable or busy timed event, or in cells `getCellState` marks unavailable. |
| `rowHeight` | `number` |  | Height of one row in pixels. Default `43`. |
| `selectedEventId` | `string` |  | Controlled selected event. |
| `slotMinutes` | `CalendarSlotMinutes` |  | Length of one row. Default `60`. |
| `timeRanges` | `readonly CalendarTimeRange<unknown>[]` |  | Host bands drawn behind the timed events. Clipped to `visibleHours`. |
| `trailingGutter` | `boolean` |  | Repeat the hour labels on the trailing edge. The copy is hidden from assistive technology. |
| `visibleDays` | `5 \| 7` |  | `5` shows Monday–Friday, `7` the whole week. Default `5`. |
| `visibleHours` | `CalendarTimeWindow` |  | Visible hours, e.g. `{ start: "06:00", end: "23:00" }`, on slot boundaries. Default: all. |
| `workingHours` | `CalendarTimeWindow` |  | Working hours; cells outside them are hatched. Also where the grid first scrolls to. Default 08:00–18:00. |

Also accepts the shared props `direction`, `locale`, `messages`, `t`, `timeZone`, `translations`; see [Internationalization](../../docs/i18n.md#per-component-overrides).

## Time axis

`visibleHours?: CalendarTimeWindow` limits the timed grid to part of the day, for example `{ start: "06:00", end: "23:00" }`. The end is exclusive, and `"00:00"` as the end means the end of the day. The default is the whole day.

`slotMinutes?: 15 | 20 | 30 | 60` sets the length of one row; the default is `60`. The gutter labels only rows that start on the hour. `visibleHours` snaps outward to whole slots: the start rounds down and the end rounds up. An empty or reversed window throws a `RangeError`.

`workingHours?: CalendarTimeWindow` sets the working part of the day; the default is 08:00–18:00. Cells outside it are not hatched (the day grid hatches them); their accessible name says "non-working hour". It is independent of `visibleHours` and also sets where the grid first scrolls to.

Events are clipped to the visible hours, and events wholly outside them are not rendered. The now line is hidden while the current time is outside them. Slots follow elapsed time, so a daylight-saving day has one slot fewer or more.

`timeRanges?: CalendarTimeRange[]` adds host bands (breaks, holds, blocked hours) drawn behind the events. Each band is `{ key, start, end, date?, metadata? }`; an `end` of `00:00` means the end of the day, and minutes are kept. `date` limits a band to one day; omitted, it draws on every visible day. Bands are clipped to `visibleHours` and drawn only when `renderTimeRange` is set. `renderTimeRange(range, { geometry })` returns the band's content. The band is `aria-hidden` and takes no pointer input, so put anything users must read in an event or the host UI. A band whose `end` is at or before its `start` throws a `RangeError`.

## Trailing gutter and part classes

`trailingGutter` repeats the hour labels on the trailing edge, as timetable views do. The copy is hidden from assistive technology, so the grid is announced once, and it follows `direction`.

`cellClassName`, `columnHeaderClassName`, and `gutterClassName` add host classes to the day cells, the day header, and every gutter label (hour rows, the all-day label, the header zone label, and the trailing copy). They are the stable styling hooks for these parts; the kit's own CSS Module class names are internal. Style by state (selected, unavailable) through `renderCell`, which receives it.

## Cell state and day headers

`getCellState(cell)` returns `{ state?, unavailable? }` per time cell, or `undefined`. `unavailable: true` draws the cell blocked, on top of the cells covered by unavailable or busy events, and sets `isUnavailable` in `renderCell`. The cell stays focusable. `state` reaches `renderCell` and the cell's `data-state` attribute. Cells in a paint range carry `isRangeStart` and `isRangeEnd` on the first and last cell of each run within one day column. Memoize `getCellState`, because it runs for every cell on each render.

`renderHeader(column)` replaces the weekday and day number of each day header. `column.date` is the day the column shows, and it is `undefined` only for the time column, which keeps its label. Use it for a greyed weekend or a closed-day header; the cell keeps `role="columnheader"`, so keep the content inside it.

## Interaction modes

- `quick-create` activates an empty timed cell by click or Enter/Space and emits `onQuickCreate`. Available events emit `onEventSelect(event, context, anchor)`, where `anchor` is the activated card element.
- `paint-and-move` paints an ordered range through pointer gestures and emits `onPaintSelect`. Enter or Space on an empty timed cell paints that one cell. `paintColorFamily` colours the painted cells; unset, they use the plain selection style. A paint that covers unavailable time is marked invalid; releasing it opens an info dialog and emits nothing. Dragging an available event emits `onMoveRequest`; the host must call `confirm` or `cancel` on the request. No move is committed by the component before confirmation. While the drag is over another slot, every slot the event spans from that slot, clipped to its day column, carries `data-drop-target` and a dashed outline. The highlight clears on drop or cancel, and when the pointer leaves the grid. Over the origin slot nothing is marked, and the highlight does not show conflicts. The target slot also shows a ghost card at the event's height and title, the source card dims, and the browser's drag image is blank. Events with a `recurrenceRule`, and events with `movable: false`, cannot be dragged; the latter still open. A timed, single-day event that can move also has a handle on its bottom edge. Dragging it, or pressing Alt+ArrowDown or Alt+ArrowUp on the card, emits `onResizeRequest({ event, to, confirm, cancel })`, where `to` is the slot that holds the new end. The card shows the new size until the host calls `confirm` or `cancel`.
- `read-only` preserves the rendered surface and event viewing, but emits none of the create, paint or move callbacks. Unavailable and `access="busy"` events are never activated.

`now?: UtcInstant` optionally controls the reference instant for the current-time marker and past-event state; when omitted, the component follows the host wall clock.

`interactionMode` and `selectedEventId` support controlled values with change callbacks. `defaultInteractionMode` and `defaultSelectedEventId` provide uncontrolled initial values.

## Density

`rowHeight?: number` sets the height of one row in pixels; the default is `43`. It must be a positive finite number, or render throws a `RangeError`. `maxEventsPerSlot?: number` caps the cards that start in one row of a day column. The earliest stay visible, and the rest hide behind a `+N` chip whose text comes from `renderOverflow(hiddenCount, cell)`. A click on the chip calls `onOverflowSelect(cell, anchor)`. Without `onOverflowSelect` the chip is plain text, not a button. Without a cap every card is drawn.

## Slots and states

`renderEventMetadata` replaces the metadata rows of the default card and keeps its button and frame; use it for one row. `getEventFrameProps` returns a `className` and a `data-tone` for the event's card frame, so host CSS can mark a conflict or busy state. It cannot set inline styles, so the focus outline stays in the kit's CSS. `renderEvent`, `renderConflict` and `renderDetail` replace host-specific event, conflict and detail content. Event contexts retain opaque `metadata`; conflict contexts retain the event and host-supplied dimension label. The default event uses `EventCard`; a custom event renders inside a button, and conflicts use `ConflictIndicator`. Loading, error, and empty-state presentation remains outside the kit: the supplied events render directly into the ordinary grid, including when the collection is empty. The custom detail slot receives `close`, which dismisses the composed detail surface without performing a backend operation.

## Accessibility and styling

The component composes `CalendarGrid` with semantic grid dimensions, one roving tab stop, keyboard movement and RTL-aware horizontal navigation. Its scroll surface is a plain scroll container owned by the component. Event cards remain keyboard-actionable, expose `data-event-id`, selected/unavailable states and focus rings. Import `@gears-frontx/calendar-kit/theme.css` once in the host; component styles use the documented `--cal-*` aliases only. Every root accepts `className`.

## 1. Feature Context

- [ ] `p1` - `cpt-frontx-dashboard-feature-widget-catalog`

### 1.1 Overview

The 9 v1 widget types, each a GTS type (the render schema), a data type (the data shape), and one FrontX MFE entry. The final render schemas and data shapes per type, the grid row cap and page sizes, the grid sorts and pages client-side over the rows the transform delivered, markdown safety, and the per-type rendering rules.

### 1.2 Purpose

A dashboard author picks from the catalog. The catalog is bounded by presentation shapes, not by subject: a new dataset needs no new widget type. Each type states the exact data it needs, and the root's registration validates every answer against it.

**Requirements**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-widget-catalog`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-grid-sort-page`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-markdown-safety`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-accessibility` (widget side), `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-theme` (widget side), `cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-visual-quality`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-large-table`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-bundle-budget`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-accessibility` (widget side), `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-author-guides` (dashboard-author guide).

**Use cases**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-usecase-add-fix-widget`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-usecase-author-dashboard` (the widget types an author picks, the dashboard-author guide).

**Principles**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-principle-open-bases-closed-leaves`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-principle-per-instance-isolation`.

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-constraint-one-gts-package`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-constraint-permissive-licences` (widget libraries).

**Components**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-component-widget-catalog` (the 9 types, libraries, rendering rules).

**Security in scope**: output safety. The markdown card follows `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-markdown`; every other widget shows delivered text as text, and chart tooltips are built from text.

**Not applicable**:
- Persistence/DB: no database (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-db-none`).
- Sign-in and access: the host signs the viewer in, and the product's API owns access.
- Compliance/privacy: widgets store nothing and send nothing; they show only what the product's API returns. Library licences are in [Catalog libraries and licences](#catalog-libraries-and-licences).
- Reliability: widgets are passive. A widget shows its own cannot-be-shown state; the root owns failure scope and recovery.
- Progress and confirmation flows: grid sort, page and page size are immediate, client-side and change no data.
- Ops/rollout: no deployed service; a widget ships as an MFE build plus its types, entry and manifest in the served GTS file.

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

### Sort and page a grid

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-flow-widget-catalog-grid-sort-page`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-actor-dashboard-viewer`

**Success Scenarios**:
- The viewer sorts a grid by a column, pages it, and changes the page size, all client-side, with no request.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - The viewer clicks a sortable column header. - `inst-wc-sort-click`
2. [ ] - `p1` - The grid sorts the rows it holds in place, as `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-sort` specifies, and shows the first page. - `inst-wc-sort-do`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the viewer pages or changes the page size - `inst-wc-page`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - The grid shows another page of the delivered rows, or applies the new page size and shows the first page, in place. - `inst-wc-page-do`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** — no request is sent, no binding re-runs. - `inst-wc-return`

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

### Render a markdown card safely

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-markdown`

**Input**: a `markdown_card` body string from its `render`.

**Output**: rendered CommonMark (formatting, links and images), with HTML as text.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Parse the body as CommonMark, including links and images. - `inst-wc-md-parse`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Render embedded HTML as plain text; create no element from it. - `inst-wc-md-html`
3. [ ] - `p1` - For each link and image target, read it the way the browser URL parser does: decode character references, remove every tab, line feed and carriage return anywhere in it, and trim leading and trailing control characters and spaces. Its scheme is the text before the first `:` when that text starts with a letter and holds only letters, digits, `+`, `-` and `.`, compared case-insensitively. A target with no scheme is relative. So `JavaScript:`, ` javascript:` and `java&#9;script:` all read as the `javascript` scheme. - `inst-wc-md-scheme`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** a link's target is not relative and its scheme is not `http`, `https` or `mailto`, render the link inactive, showing its link text as plain text. This covers `javascript`, `vbscript`, `data`, `blob`, `file` and every other scheme. - `inst-wc-md-links`
5. [ ] - `p1` - Open every other link in a new browsing context, without access to the opener. - `inst-wc-md-noopener`
6. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** an image's target is not a same-origin path, do not load it; show its alt text, or nothing when it has none. A same-origin path is a relative target that resolves against the page URL to the page origin. Every target with a scheme is blocked, including `https`, `data` (also `data:image/*`), `blob` and `javascript`; so is a relative target that resolves to another origin, such as `//other.example/a.png`. Otherwise show the image with its alt text as the accessible name. - `inst-wc-md-images`
7. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the rendered text. - `inst-wc-md-return`

### Take chart colours from kit tokens

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-chart-theme`

**Input**: the host theme id, and the series of a `cartesian_chart` or the slices of a `pie_chart`.

**Output**: a kit `ChartConfig` whose colours are kit chart tokens, followed by the active light or dark scope.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Map the host theme id to the ui-kit light or dark scope (unknown gives light). - `inst-wc-chart-scope`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Give each series or slice, in delivered order, a step of the kit's series palette in a fixed order that keeps neighbours apart (`--chart-5`, `--chart-4`, `--chart-2`, `--chart-1`, `--chart-3`), wrapping after the fifth, with its name as the label. - `inst-wc-chart-build`
3. [ ] - `p1` - Pass the config to the kit `ChartContainer`, which writes one `--color-<key>` property per entry for the chart instance; every series paints itself with its property. - `inst-wc-chart-register`
4. [ ] - `p1` - On a theme change, build nothing: the kit tokens take their values from the new scope, and the chart restyles with no request. - `inst-wc-chart-rebuild`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the config. - `inst-wc-chart-return`

### Validate grid columns and groups

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-checks`

**Input**: the `render_widget` payload of a `grid`: its `render` and its validated data.

**Output**: pass, or a failure naming the problem.

The grid widget runs these checks itself, each time it accepts a `render_widget` payload and before it draws. The root has no per-type knowledge and does not run them. On a failure, the widget draws no rows, shows its own cannot-be-shown state in its cell (the static localized "This widget cannot be shown", exposed as text, as `cpt-frontx-dashboard-dod-widget-contract-obligations` specifies), and writes the problem to the browser console (never data content). The cell frame stays and the other cells are unaffected.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** two columns share the same `key`, **RETURN** failure naming the widget and the key. - `inst-wc-grid-dup-key`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** group in `column_groups` - `inst-wc-grid-for-group`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** a key in `members` is not the `key` of a grid column, **RETURN** failure naming the widget, the group, and the key. - `inst-wc-grid-group-member`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the columns of the group are not contiguous in `columns` order, **RETURN** failure naming the widget and the group. - `inst-wc-grid-not-contiguous`
   3. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** a key is repeated within the group, **RETURN** failure naming the widget, the group, and the key. - `inst-wc-grid-repeated`
   4. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** a column of the group is also named by another group, **RETURN** failure naming the widget, the column, and both groups. - `inst-wc-grid-two-groups`
3. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** `row_color` is set and is not the `key` of a grid column, **RETURN** failure naming the widget and the key. - `inst-wc-grid-row-color`
4. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** any data row does not have exactly one value per column (its length differs from the number of `columns`), **RETURN** failure naming the widget and the first such row index. - `inst-wc-grid-positions`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** pass. - `inst-wc-grid-pass`

### Sort and page grid rows

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-sort`

**Input**: the delivered grid rows, the sort column and direction chosen by the viewer, and the page size.

**Output**: the rows in sorted order, showing the first page.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - Follow the header cycle of the ui-kit DataGrid: a click on a column that is not the sort column makes it the only sort column, descending; a second click sorts it ascending; a third click clears the sort, and the rows return to their delivered order. Only the sort column's header shows a sort state. - `inst-wc-sort-direction`
2. [ ] - `p1` - Group the values of the sort column by kind: numbers first, then strings, then nulls. The groups keep this order in both directions. - `inst-wc-sort-groups`
3. [ ] - `p1` - Within the number group, compare numerically. Within the string group, compare with the collator of the host language. Reverse the order within both groups for a descending sort. Nulls stay last in both directions. - `inst-wc-sort-compare`
4. [ ] - `p1` - Keep the delivered order of rows whose sort values are equal (a stable sort). - `inst-wc-sort-stable`
5. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the sort changes or the viewer changes the page size, show the first page. - `inst-wc-sort-first-page`
6. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** the sorted rows; no request is sent. - `inst-wc-sort-return`

### Check the heatmap scale

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-heatmap-checks`

**Input**: the `render_widget` payload of a `heatmap`: its `render`.

**Output**: pass, or a failure naming the problem.

The heatmap widget runs this check itself, each time it accepts a `render_widget` payload and before it draws, with the same outcome as `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-checks`: on a failure, it shows its own cannot-be-shown state in its cell and writes the problem to the browser console.

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** `min_value` and `max_value` are both set (not null) and `min_value` is greater than `max_value`, **RETURN** failure naming both values. - `inst-wc-heat-min-max`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** pass. - `inst-wc-heat-pass`

### Check cartesian x values

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-cartesian-checks`

**Input**: the `render_widget` payload of a `cartesian_chart`: its `render` and its validated data.

**Output**: pass, or a failure naming the problem.

The chart widget runs this check itself, each time it accepts a `render_widget` payload and before it draws, with the same outcome as `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-checks`: on a failure, it shows its own cannot-be-shown state in its cell and writes the problem to the browser console (never data content).

**Steps**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** point with a non-null `x` - `inst-wc-cart-for-point`
   1. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the x axis is `value` and `x` is not a number, **RETURN** failure naming the series and the point index. - `inst-wc-cart-value-x`
   2. [ ] - `p1` - **IF** the x axis is `time` and `x` is neither an ISO 8601 date-time string nor a number of epoch milliseconds, **RETURN** failure naming the series and the point index. - `inst-wc-cart-time-x`
2. [ ] - `p1` - **RETURN** pass. A `category` axis accepts every `x`. - `inst-wc-cart-pass`

## 4. States (CDSL)

### No lifecycle states

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-state-widget-catalog-none`

**States**: `defined` (the catalog is data and rendering rules, with no lifecycle)

**Initial State**: `defined`

**Transitions**:
1. [ ] - `p1` - **FROM** `defined` **TO** `defined` **WHEN** a widget type is rendered (no transition; the catalog is static data). - `inst-wc-state-none`

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Nine widget types

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-dod-widget-catalog-types`

The system **MUST** ship 9 widget types, each a closed derived GTS type with `unevaluatedProperties: false`, setting `entry` and (for data widgets) `data_type`: `summary_card`, `metric_card`, `ranked_list_card`, `progress_list_card`, `grid`, `cartesian_chart`, `pie_chart`, `heatmap` (derived from `data_widget`), and `markdown_card` (derived from the widget base, forbidding `data`, carrying its text in `render`).

Each widget type has one FrontX MFE entry, a plain `entry_mf` instance with `actions` [`render_widget`] and `domainActions` []; the FrontX manifest pipeline adds `exposeAssets` at registration. The full entry instances and the entry id table are in [MFE entries](#mfe-entries).

**Implements**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-widget-catalog`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-usecase-add-fix-widget`.

**Principles**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-principle-open-bases-closed-leaves` (each concrete type closes itself).

**Touches**:
- Entities: the 9 widget types, the 8 data types, the 9 entries

### Per-type render schemas and data shapes

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-dod-widget-catalog-shapes`

Each data widget type **MUST** declare a closed `render` schema and a closed data shape derived from the widget-data base. Every data widget type inherits the optional `value_format` from `data_widget` and declares nothing for it; each type closes only its own `render`. The widget formats every number it shows by `value_format` for the host language: `number` (also when `value_format` is absent) as a plain number, `percent` as a percentage (0.25 shows as 25%), and `duration` as the number in its `unit` (`ms`, `s`, `min`, `h` or `d`) with the localized unit, without converting to another unit. Value fields accept `null` (shown as a gap or empty value). Each data type states its empty condition in its Presentation line. The full render schema and data shape of every type are in [Widget Type and Data Schemas](#6-widget-type-and-data-schemas); the DESIGN worked example uses them.

**Implements**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-widget-catalog`.

**Touches**:
- Entities: the 9 widget types, the 8 data types

### Grid row cap, page sizes, and client-side sort/page

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-dod-widget-catalog-grid`

The grid's transform output **MUST** have a row cap of 500 rows (`maxItems` on the grid data type's `rows`). The grid **MUST** always page, with page sizes defaulting to `[10, 25, 50, 100, 500]` (the first entry is the initial page size), and sort and page client-side over the rows the transform delivered, sending no request. An over-cap result fails data validation and the cell shows the cannot-be-shown state; rows are never truncated. Sorting and paging follow `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-sort`. The grid is the ui-kit DataGrid, whose `load` callback answers from the delivered rows in memory, with its state kept in memory only (ADR-0005). Grid columns are keyed by position: `render.columns[i]` describes position `i` and has a required `key` (unique, `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}$`). `column_groups[].members` and `row_color` refer to column keys. The grid widget runs the consistency checks of `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-checks` itself and shows its own cannot-be-shown state when one fails.

**Implements**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-flow-widget-catalog-grid-sort-page`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-checks`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-sort`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-grid-sort-page`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-large-table`.

### Markdown safety

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-dod-widget-catalog-markdown`

`markdown_card` **MUST** render its body exactly as `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-markdown` specifies: embedded HTML as text, targets read the way the browser URL parser reads them, links active only for `http`, `https`, `mailto` and relative targets and opened in a new browsing context with no opener, and images loaded only from same-origin paths.

**Implements**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-markdown`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-markdown-safety`.

### Per-type rendering rules

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-dod-widget-catalog-rendering`

Each widget entry **MUST** follow the widget-author obligations of `cpt-frontx-dashboard-dod-widget-contract-obligations`. Chart widgets draw with the ui-kit chart component and take their colours from kit tokens (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-chart-theme`, ADR-0004); the heatmap draws its tiles from kit tokens. The root has no chart-library dependency. The set of host theme ids that map to dark is enumerated in the theme helper and updated when the host adds a dark theme; themes beyond light and dark fold into one of the two.

**Per-type rules:** each type's presentation rules are stated once, with its schemas in [Widget Type and Data Schemas](#6-widget-type-and-data-schemas). `metric_card` with `value_label` shows it as the caption; without it, no caption shows.

**Cross-type rules:**

- A null label, `x`, `y` or series value is legal; it renders as an empty label and the row is kept.
- Empty state: the widget owns it. When its data meets the empty condition of its data type, the widget shows the localized "No data to show" inside its cell, and the cell frame stays.
- The `grid`, `heatmap` and `cartesian_chart` widgets run their own cross-checks (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-checks`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-heatmap-checks`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-cartesian-checks`) and show their own cannot-be-shown state when one fails: the static localized "This widget cannot be shown" with no error text, exposed as text to assistive technology, as `cpt-frontx-dashboard-dod-widget-contract-obligations` specifies.
- Chart tooltips are built from text, never HTML strings.
- Colour is never the only signal: the heatmap's numeric scale, progress values as text, the trend icon, and naming in legends and tooltips.
- Legends: a legend takes at most half of its chart (its height above or below the plot, its width beside it) and scrolls beyond that, so the plot or the pie keeps room in a short cell.
- Text alternatives: `cartesian_chart`, `pie_chart` and `heatmap` each expose a localized accessible name and a text alternative of the delivered values for assistive technology.
- Drill-down: a `cartesian_chart` or `pie_chart` whose `render.drill_down` is `true` shows a "Show data" button that switches its area to the data view, and back with "Show chart". The data view is a ui-kit DataGrid of every delivered value, one row per x position (or per point for an all-scatter chart, per slice for a pie), sortable client-side, with no request. A click on a bar, point or segment opens the data view with the row of that mark opened (its fields listed under it), marked, and scrolled to the top of the data view, under its header, so its fields show below it. The data view is at least as wide as a minimum width per column, and a data view wider than its cell scrolls sideways inside it. With `drill_down` off or absent the chart has no clickable marks. The button keeps the data view reachable by keyboard. Each progress bar of `progress_list_card` has `role="progressbar"`, with its current and target values as text. The `metric_card` trend icon has a localized accessible name (up, down or no change).

**Principles**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-principle-per-instance-isolation` (each chart widget evaluates its own copy of its chart library).

**Implements**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-theme` (widget side), `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-accessibility`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-visual-quality`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-heatmap-checks`, `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-cartesian-checks`.

### Catalog libraries and licences

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-dod-widget-catalog-libraries`

The catalog widgets **MUST** use the ui-kit chart component with Recharts (MIT, pinned to the version ui-kit pins) for `cartesian_chart` and `pie_chart`, the ui-kit DataGrid for `grid` and the chart data view, and markdown-it (MIT; CommonMark with raw HTML off and a link validation hook) for `markdown_card`, listed in `shared`, each entry under 100 KB own code only. The heatmap uses no chart library.

**Implements**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-bundle-budget`.

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-constraint-permissive-licences`.

### Widget accessibility walkthrough

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-dod-widget-catalog-accessibility`

Every one of the 9 widget types **MUST** pass the host's accessibility checks in both the light and the dark theme, with the text alternatives and keyboard operation of [Per-type rendering rules](#per-type-rendering-rules). Each widget's controls expose their name, role and state, and its empty state ("No data to show") and its own cannot-be-shown state are exposed as text, so a screen reader tells them apart from the root's loaders. This is verified by a keyboard-only walkthrough and a screen-reader walkthrough of the reference dashboard in both themes, covering every widget type in its cell and in the larger view.

**Implements**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-accessibility` (widget side), `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-accessibility`.

### Dashboard-author guide

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-dod-widget-catalog-author-guide`

The template **MUST** ship a dashboard-author guide covering writing a dashboard JSON, the grid, the binding, the catalog, and the layout checks. It **MUST** also cover that the product owns dashboard and data size, that every viewer who may see a dashboard must be able to get its widgets' data, that the product's API owns errors and access, what the host must provide, and the documented limitations: the limitations of PRD §6.3 and the DESIGN limits listed in DESIGN §5. A walkthrough with someone who did not build the template **MUST** show that the guide alone is enough to write a working dashboard: a dashboard author who has not used the template before writes a first working dashboard from the guide in one working session.

**Implements**: `cpt-frontx-dashboard-fr-author-guides` (dashboard-author guide).

**Touches**:
- Entities: Dashboard, Cell, Widget instance, Binding

## 6. Widget Type and Data Schemas

Every schema is a full JSON block with `$schema` `https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema`, `$id` `gts://<type id>`, and the GTS rules in DESIGN §3.1. Each concrete widget type is closed (`unevaluatedProperties: false`), derives from `data_widget` (or the widget base for `markdown_card`), and sets `x-gts-traits` `{entry, data_type}`. Presentation fields sit in a closed `render`. Each data type is closed and derives from the widget-data base.

### MFE entries

One `entry_mf` instance per widget type. Each entry has `actions` [`render_widget`], `domainActions` [], `requiredProperties` (theme and language), `manifest`, and `exposedModule` `./<widget_type>`; the FrontX manifest pipeline adds `exposeAssets` at registration.

**Entry instances:**

```json
{
  "id": "gts.frontx.mfes.mfe.entry.v1~frontx.mfes.mfe.entry_mf.v1~frontx.dashboard.mfe.summary_card.v1",
  "requiredProperties": [
    "gts.frontx.mfes.comm.shared_property.v1~frontx.mfes.comm.theme.v1~",
    "gts.frontx.mfes.comm.shared_property.v1~frontx.mfes.comm.language.v1~"
  ],
  "actions": [
    "gts.frontx.mfes.comm.action.v1~frontx.dashboard.mfe.render_widget.v1~"
  ],
  "domainActions": [],
  "manifest": "gts.frontx.mfes.mfe.mf_manifest.v1~frontx.dashboard.widgets.manifest.v1",
  "exposedModule": "./summary_card"
}

      }
    }
  ],
  "unevaluatedProperties": false
}
```

**Cross-references**:
- Presentation: one label/value line per row, in delivered order. A null value shows as an empty value after its label. A null label shows as an empty label and the row stays.
- Empty state: `rows` is empty. The widget shows the localized "No data to show".

### metric_card

**GTS ID**: `gts.frontx.dashboard.widget.widget.v1~frontx.dashboard.widget.data_widget.v1~frontx.dashboard.widget.metric_card.v1~`

**Description**: A card with one headline value, an optional trend against `previous_value`, and an optional sparkline.

          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "unevaluatedProperties": false
}
```

**Data type schema:**

```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.frontx.dashboard.widget_data.widget_data.v1~frontx.dashboard.widget_data.metric_card.v1~",
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "MetricCardData",
  "description": "Data of a metric_card widget.",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.frontx.dashboard.widget_data.widget_data.v1~" },
    {
      "type": "object",

        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "unevaluatedProperties": false
}
```

**Cross-references**:
- Presentation: the headline is `value`. The trend compares `value` with `previous_value` and shows a direction icon (up for an increase, down for a decrease, flat for no change) together with the change, so its meaning does not depend on colour. The trend icon has a localized accessible name (up, down or no change). The change is the relative percent `(value − previous_value) / |previous_value|`, formatted for the host language. When `previous_value` is 0 or null, no change is shown: a 0 shows the direction icon alone, and a null shows no trend; the headline stays. The sparkline draws one point per step, and a null point is a gap.
- Empty state: `value` is null. The widget shows the localized "No data to show".

### ranked_list_card

**GTS ID**: `gts.frontx.dashboard.widget.widget.v1~frontx.dashboard.widget.data_widget.v1~frontx.dashboard.widget.ranked_list_card.v1~`

**Description**: A card with one ranked item for each data row: the rank is the delivered position, followed by the label, the value, and an optional secondary value.

**Widget type schema:**

      "properties": {
        "rows": {
          "type": "array",
          "description": "Rows in the delivered order. secondary is omitted when the data has no secondary value.",
          "items": {

          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "unevaluatedProperties": false
}
```

**Cross-references**:
- Presentation: the first row has rank 1, the second rank 2, and so on. The widget never re-ranks or re-orders the rows. `secondary` is optional; when absent, its column and heading are hidden. `value_label` and `secondary_label` replace the default headings of the two values. A null value or a null secondary value shows as an empty value. A null label shows as an empty label and the row stays.
- Empty state: `rows` is empty. The widget shows the localized "No data to show".

### progress_list_card

**GTS ID**: `gts.frontx.dashboard.widget.widget.v1~frontx.dashboard.widget.data_widget.v1~frontx.dashboard.widget.progress_list_card.v1~`

**Description**: A card with one progress bar for each data row, showing the current value against the target.

**Widget type schema:**

          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "unevaluatedProperties": false
}
```

**Cross-references**:
- Presentation: the bar fills in proportion to `current` over `target`, and it is full when `current` reaches or exceeds `target`. With a null or zero target, or a null `current`, the bar stays empty, and a null value shows as an empty value. The current and target values are always shown as text, so the bar does not carry meaning alone. Each bar has `role="progressbar"`, named by its label, with its current and target values as text. Bar colours come from kit tokens of the active scope. A null label shows as an empty label and the row stays.
- Empty state: `rows` is empty. The widget shows the localized "No data to show".

### grid

**Cross-references**:
- Data: each row is a positional array. Column `i` reads its value from `rows[r][i]`. Cells show their value as text, formatted by the column's `format.notation` and the widget's `value_format`. A null value shows an empty cell. The grid has no cell renderers. A long value wraps and is never cut off, unless its column's `overflow` is `truncate`: then the cell keeps one line, ends in an ellipsis and keeps the full text as its title. The column heading is the column's `title`, or its `key` when it has no `title`.
- Links: a value `{text, href}` shows as a link with its `text`, opened in a new tab with no opener, only when `href` is `http`, `https` or relative to the same site (not starting with `//` or `\\`), read the way the browser URL parser reads it (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-markdown`, step 3); any other target shows `text` as plain text. A link sorts by its text.
- Paging: the grid always shows one page. The viewer pages and changes the page size client-side, sending no request. The pager shows the position and the total.
- Sorting: one active sort column, following the header cycle of the ui-kit DataGrid: descending, ascending, then the delivered order; only that header shows a sort state, exposed with `aria-sort`. Sorting is client-side over the rows the transform delivered. The comparison, null placement, stability and the reset to the first page follow `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-sort`.
- Frozen columns: the first `frozen_columns` columns stay visible at the leading edge while the viewer scrolls horizontally. A value larger than the number of columns freezes all columns. A group is frozen as a whole, so a count that ends inside a group freezes the whole group.
- Column groups: each group shows its `title` once, in a heading row above the column headings, spanning exactly its columns. A column outside every group has an empty cell in that heading row. Without `column_groups`, the grid has a single heading row.
- Row colour: with `row_color` set, a row whose value is one of `success`, `warning`, `error`, or `info`, matched exactly and case-sensitively, takes the row background of the kit token of that meaning in the active light or dark scope. The row also shows an icon of that meaning, with an accessible name in the host language. A null or any other value leaves the row uncoloured, and cell text keeps readable contrast.
- Empty state: `rows` is empty. The widget shows the localized "No data to show".
- Consistency checks: the grid widget runs `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-grid-checks` and shows its own cannot-be-shown state when one fails — there is exactly one column per data position, group members are columns, groups are contiguous, there are no repeats inside a group, no column belongs to two groups, and `row_color` names a column.

**Cross-references**:
- Presentation: on a category axis the x positions follow the delivered order, and on a value or time axis they are placed by value. On a time axis, `x` is an ISO 8601 date-time string or a number of epoch milliseconds. A non-null `x` that does not fit the axis type makes the widget show its own cannot-be-shown state (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-cartesian-checks`). A null value is a gap. On a value or time axis, a line or area with no point at an x where another series has one is drawn straight through between its own points there (straight on the axis scale, so on a log axis between the logarithms), and no value is shown for it at that x; on a category axis, a series with no point at a category has a gap there, as a missing value. A series that repeats an x keeps every point: on a category axis each repeat has its own position, in delivered order. A null x shows as an empty label on a category axis; on a value or time axis a point with a null x has no position and is left out. A null series name shows as an empty label. Every series is named in the tooltip and, unless `legend_position` is `none`, in the legend, so series do not differ by colour alone. Numbers follow `value_format`, except on a series of the secondary axis, which shows plain numbers followed by the secondary axis `unit`; the tooltip, the value labels, the text alternative and the data view use the same formats. On a time axis, points that all fall on a midnight are days: every view shows the date alone, read in UTC when every point is a UTC midnight, so a day keeps its date in any time zone. Otherwise the x ticks show the time of day when the points span less than two days (with the day when they cross a local midnight) and dates beyond that, and the tooltip, the text alternative and the data view show the date with the time (seconds when a point has them). A data series without an entry in `render.series` draws as bars on the primary axis. A series `label` is written at that series' last point in the text colour, with a halo of the card colour where it crosses a bar, and moved up so it never covers a bar's value label at that point. Rotated tick labels stay on one line. Each axis `label` is written on its axis: the x title under the ticks, a y title along its axis outside the ticks. The chart has a localized accessible name and a text alternative of the delivered series, x and y values.
- Empty state: `series` is empty, or no series has a point. The widget shows the localized "No data to show".
- Chart colours: the series colours, grid lines, axes, tooltip and legend are kit tokens of the active scope (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-chart-theme`, ADR-0004).
- Render options: `value_labels` writes each bar's value at its end, above a bar that grows up and below one that grows down (a zero bar has none), formatted by `value_format`; `auto` writes them only when every bar is wide enough, so a larger-view widget can set `auto` and show them where a cell has no room. `tick_labels` and `tick_angle` shape the x axis; `tick_labels: every` applies to a category axis, and a value or time axis keeps its own number ticks apart as with `auto`. A series with `label` shows that name at its last point, so a target line is named on the chart. A secondary axis shows `unit` after its tick values. `drill_down` follows the drill-down rule in [Per-type rendering rules](#per-type-rendering-rules).

The chart has a localized accessible name and a text alternative of the delivered labels and values.
- Empty state: `slices` is empty. The widget shows the localized "No data to show".

**Cross-references**:
- Presentation: the x and y categories follow the order of their first appearance in the delivered rows. The heatmap shows its colour scale with numbers, and the tooltip of each cell shows its x, y, and value, so values do not depend on colour alone. A null value leaves its cell empty. The colour scale is built from kit tokens of the active scope. The heatmap has a localized accessible name and a text alternative of the delivered x, y and values.
- Min/max check: when `min_value` is greater than `max_value`, the widget shows its own cannot-be-shown state (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-heatmap-checks`).
- Empty state: `rows` is empty. The widget shows the localized "No data to show".

### markdown_card

**GTS ID**: `gts.frontx.dashboard.widget.widget.v1~frontx.dashboard.widget.markdown_card.v1~`

**Description**: A card that shows its markdown `body` (CommonMark, with embedded HTML shown as text). It is not a data widget: it has no `data`, no `data_type` trait, and it never requests data.

**Cross-references**:
- Rendering: the card renders right after `render_widget`, with no data states, and sends no request.
- Markdown: the body is typical markdown, CommonMark including links and images. The card shows the formatting, the links, and the images.
- Safety: embedded HTML, links and images follow `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-markdown`.
- Other widgets: the markdown card is the only widget that interprets markup. Every other delivered text is rendered as text.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The 9 widget types ship, each closed with `unevaluatedProperties: false`; `markdown_card` forbids `data`; the 8 data types derive from the widget-data base.
- [ ] A misspelled render field on a concrete widget type fails validation and the widget gets the cannot-be-shown state.
- [ ] The grid sorts and pages client-side over the rows the transform delivered, up to the 500-row cap, with page sizes defaulting to `[10, 25, 50, 100, 500]`, sending no request.
- [ ] `markdown_card` renders CommonMark as `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-markdown` specifies.
- [ ] Given a `markdown_card`, when `render_widget {render}` arrives, then it shows its body at once, sends no request, and shows no loader or empty state.
- [ ] A `null` value field is shown as a gap or empty value; a `null` `value` on `metric_card` is the empty state.
- [ ] Given a chart widget, when the host theme switches from light to dark, then its colours take the dark values of the kit chart tokens, and no request is sent, no loader shows, and nothing is remounted.
- [ ] Given a widget whose title, a label, or a chart tooltip value holds `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`, when it renders, then the text is shown as text and no element is created.
- [ ] Given a `markdown_card` whose body holds a heading, a raw `<b>` tag, a link with an `https` target, a link with a `mailto` target, and an image, when it renders, then the heading is formatted, no element is created from the raw tag and the tag shows as plain text, the links open in a new browsing context without access to the opener, and the image is shown with its alt text as accessible name.
- [ ] Given a `markdown_card` whose body holds links with the targets `javascript:alert(1)`, `JavaScript:alert(1)`, and ` javascript:alert(1)` (leading space), when it renders, then no link is active and each shows its text as plain text.
- [ ] Given a `markdown_card` whose body holds links with the targets `<java	script:alert(1)>` (a real tab inside), `java&#9;script:alert(1)` (an encoded tab), and `java&#10;script:alert(1)` (an encoded line feed), when it renders, then each target reads as the `javascript` scheme, no link is active, and each shows its text as plain text.
- [ ] Given a `markdown_card` whose body holds links with the targets `vbscript:x`, `data:text/html,x`, `blob:x`, `file:///etc/passwd`, and `custom-app:open`, when it renders, then no link is active. Given links with the targets `https://example.com`, `http://example.com`, `mailto:a@example.com`, and `reports/weekly`, then each link is active and opens in a new browsing context without access to the opener.
- [ ] Given a `markdown_card` whose body holds images with the targets `javascript:alert(1)`, `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo=`, `blob:x`, `https://other.example/a.png`, and `//other.example/a.png`, when it renders, then none of them is loaded and each shows its alt text, or nothing when it has none. Given an image with the target `/assets/logo.png`, then the image loads from the page origin with its alt text as accessible name.
- [ ] Given a `metric_card` whose data has `value` 120 and `previous_value` 100, when it renders, then it shows the up direction icon and a change. The change is a relative increase of 20 percent. Given `value` 80, then it shows the down icon and a relative decrease of 20 percent, and given `value` 100, the flat icon and a change of 0 percent. Given `previous_value` 0, then it shows the direction icon and no change. Given a null `previous_value`, then it shows the headline and no trend. In each case, the trend icon has a localized accessible name for up, down or no change.
- [ ] Given a `metric_card` whose data has a `sparkline`, when it renders, then the sparkline draws one point per step, and a null point is a gap.
- [ ] Given a `metric_card` with `value_label` "Open alerts", then the caption shows it. Without `value_label`, no caption shows.
- [ ] Given a `summary_card` with 3 rows, when it renders, then it shows 3 lines in delivered order, each with its label and formatted value, and a null value as an empty value.
- [ ] Given a `ranked_list_card` with `value_label` and `secondary_label`, when it renders, then the two headings show these labels. Given data with no `secondary`, then no secondary value and no secondary heading show.
- [ ] Given a `progress_list_card` with rows (current 120, target 100), (50, 100), (10, null), and (null, 100), when it renders, then the first bar is full, the second is half full, the third and the fourth are empty, and every value shows as text, empty for a null. Each bar has `role="progressbar"`, is named by its label, and exposes its current and target values as text.
- [ ] Given a `grid` with a column whose `align` is `end`, one whose `format.notation` is `compact` over a number value, one with `compact` while the widget's `value_format` is `percent`, and one with a `title`, when it renders, then the first body is end-aligned, the number is abbreviated, the percent still shows as a percentage, and the heading shows the title.
- [ ] Given a `grid` with 8 columns and `frozen_columns` 2, when the viewer scrolls to the last column, then the first 2 columns stay visible. With `frozen_columns` 0 or absent, all columns scroll.
- [ ] Given a `grid` whose `column_groups` lists a group "Group B" over `c5` and `c6` before a group "Group A" over `c3` and `c4`, when it renders, then a heading row shows "Group A" once over `c3` and `c4` and "Group B" once over `c5` and `c6`, in column position.
- [ ] Given a `grid` with `row_color` set to a column whose values are "error", "Error", "unknown", and null, when it renders in the light scope, then the "error" row takes the error token background of the light scope and shows the error icon with its accessible name, and the other rows show no colour and no icon. When the host theme switches to dark, then the "error" row takes the error token background of the dark scope and no request is sent.
- [ ] Given a `grid` showing rows, when the viewer clicks a sortable column header, then the grid sorts by that column descending; a second click sorts it ascending, and a third click returns the delivered order. Only that header shows a sort state, with `aria-sort`.
- [ ] Given a `grid` whose sortable column holds, in delivered rows r1 to r7, the values 10, "Banana", null, 2, "apple", 2, and null, with host language English, when the viewer sorts ascending, then the row order is r4, r6, r1, r5, r2, r3, r7 (numbers numerically, then strings by the collator, then nulls; equal values keep delivered order). When the viewer sorts descending, then the row order is r1, r4, r6, r2, r5, r3, r7 (nulls stay last).
- [ ] Given a `grid` on its third page, when the viewer sorts by a column, then the grid shows the first page. Given a `grid` on its third page, when the viewer changes the page size, then the grid shows the first page.
- [ ] Given a `grid`, when the viewer changes the page or page size, then the grid pages in place, sending no request.
- [ ] Given a `grid` with no rows, then it shows "No data to show".
- [ ] Given a `grid` whose data has more than 500 rows, then it fails data validation and the cell shows the cannot-be-shown state; rows are never truncated.
- [ ] Given a `grid` page of 500 rows, when the viewer scrolls from the first row to the last, then the view stays responsive in the light and the dark scope (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-large-table`).
- [ ] Given a `grid`, when it is inspected, then its table exposes its headers and the sort state of the sorted header (`aria-sort`), its pager is a named navigation landmark, and the sort, page and page size controls can be operated with the keyboard alone.
- [ ] Given a `grid` with a link value whose `href` is `https://example.org/a`, and one whose `href` is `javascript:alert(1)`, when it renders, then the first is a link that opens in a new tab with no opener, and the second shows its text as plain text.
- [ ] Given a `grid` column whose `overflow` is `truncate` and a value longer than the column, when it renders, then the cell keeps one line, ends in an ellipsis and carries the full value as its title.
- [ ] Given a `grid` whose `columns` has two entries with the same `key`, whose `column_groups` names a key that is not a column, whose group columns are not contiguous, whose column is in two groups, whose `row_color` is not a column key, or whose member is repeated within one group, when the widget receives `render_widget`, then in each case the widget draws no rows, shows its own cannot-be-shown state in its cell, and writes the problem to the browser console; the other cells are unaffected. Given a `grid` whose data has a row with fewer or more values than `columns`, when the widget receives `render_widget`, then the widget shows its own cannot-be-shown state in the same way.
- [ ] Given a `cartesian_chart` with a category x axis, when it renders, then the x positions follow the delivered order. With a value or time x axis, points are placed by value. A null value is a gap; a null x or series name is an empty label. Every series is named in the legend and the tooltip.
- [ ] Given a `cartesian_chart` whose data has a series with no entry in `render.series`, when it renders, then that series draws as bars on the primary axis.
- [ ] Given a `cartesian_chart` with two series and a `render.series` entry for each, one drawn as bars and one as a line on the secondary y axis, when it renders, then the legend names both series and a null value is a gap in the line.
- [ ] Given a `cartesian_chart` with a `time` x axis and points whose `x` values are "2026-10-01T00:00:00Z", 1790899200000 (epoch milliseconds for 2026-10-02T00:00:00Z), and "2026-10-03T12:00:00+02:00", when it renders, then each point is placed at its time.
- [ ] Given a `cartesian_chart` with a `time` x axis, a line "Requests" with points at 10:00, 10:05 and 10:10, and a line "Errors" with points at 10:02 and 10:07 of one day, when it renders, then each line is drawn unbroken through its own points, the ticks show times of day, and the tooltip, the text alternative and the data view show the date and time of each point, with no value for a series at a time it has no point.
- [ ] Given a `cartesian_chart` with two line series in the same `stack_group` on the same y axis, when it renders, then the second line is drawn at the sum of both series, and the tooltip and the data view show each series' own value.
- [ ] Given a `cartesian_chart` with `x_axis.label` "Elapsed seconds", `y_axis.label` "Requests" and `y_axis_secondary.label` "CPU", when it renders, then each title is written on its axis without covering a tick label.
- [ ] Given a `cartesian_chart` with a `time` x axis and a point whose `x` is "last week", or a `value` x axis and a point whose `x` is "ten", when the widget receives `render_widget`, then it shows its own cannot-be-shown state in its cell and writes the problem to the browser console; the other cells are unaffected.
- [ ] Given a `pie_chart`, when it renders, then the legend and tooltip show each segment's label and value. A null or zero segment has no size but stays in the legend.
- [ ] Given a `pie_chart` with `radius` ["40%", "70%"], when it renders, then it draws a donut. Given `radius` ["big"], then validation fails.
- [ ] Given a `cartesian_chart` or `pie_chart` with `drill_down` `true`, when the viewer activates "Show data", then the area shows the data view with every delivered value and no request is sent; when the viewer clicks a mark, the data view opens with that mark's row opened and marked. With `drill_down` absent, the chart has no "Show data" button and no clickable marks.
- [ ] Given a `cartesian_chart` with `value_labels` `always`, a line series with `label` "Goal" and `line_style` `dashed`, and a secondary axis with `unit` "%", when it renders, then every bar shows its value, the line is dashed and named "Goal" at its last point, and the secondary ticks end in "%".
- [ ] Given a `heatmap`, when it renders, then the categories follow first-appearance order, the scale is shown with numbers, the tooltip shows x, y, and value, and a null value leaves the cell empty.
- [ ] Given a `heatmap` with `min_value` 0, `max_value` 100, and `show_cell_values` true, when it renders, then the colour scale runs from 0 to 100 and each cell shows its value. Given `min_value` and `max_value` absent or null, then the scale takes the lowest and the highest value in the data.
- [ ] Given a `heatmap` whose `min_value` is greater than its `max_value`, when the widget receives `render_widget`, then it shows its own cannot-be-shown state in its cell and writes the problem to the browser console, as `cpt-frontx-dashboard-algo-widget-catalog-heatmap-checks` specifies; the other cells are unaffected.
- [ ] Given a data widget whose answer has a null label, x, y, or series value, when it renders, then that value shows as an empty label and the row or point stays.
- [ ] Given a chart widget, when it builds a tooltip, then the tooltip is built from text, never from HTML strings.
- [ ] Given a widget, when it conveys meaning, then colour is never the only signal: the heatmap's numeric scale, progress values as text, the trend icon, and series and segment naming in legends and tooltips all carry the meaning.
- [ ] Given the dashboard root, when it is inspected, then it has no chart-library dependency.
- [ ] Given a widget, when the host theme id maps to dark, then it uses the dark ui-kit scope; an unknown id gives light. The set of dark theme ids is enumerated and updated when the host adds a dark theme.
- [ ] Given the reference dashboard, when all 9 widget types are inspected in both scopes, in a cell and in the larger view, against the design-system reference, then every colour, font, and spacing value comes from kit tokens (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-visual-quality`), and no widget conveys meaning by colour alone (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-accessibility`).
- [ ] Given a dashboard with one cell of each data widget type, when one cell's transform output breaks its data type, then that cell shows the cannot-be-shown state and every other cell is unaffected. Each of these fixtures, run on its own, gives this result:
  - `summary_card`: a row `{"label": "A", "value": "12"}` (wrong type); a row `{"label": "A"}` (missing `value`); a row `{"label": "A", "value": 1, "unit": "x"}` (extra field).
  - `metric_card`: `{"value": "12"}` (wrong type); `{"previous_value": 1}` (missing `value`); `{"value": 1, "trend": "up"}` (extra field).
  - `ranked_list_card`: a row `{"label": "A", "value": "12"}` (wrong type); a row `{"label": "A"}` (missing `value`); a row `{"label": "A", "value": 1, "rank": 1}` (extra field).
  - `progress_list_card`: a row `{"label": "A", "current": "50", "target": 100}` (wrong type); a row `{"label": "A", "current": 50}` (missing `target`); a row `{"label": "A", "current": 50, "target": 100, "percent": 50}` (extra field).
  - `grid`: a row `["A", true]` (wrong type); `{}` (missing `rows`); `{"rows": [], "columns": []}` (extra field).
  - `cartesian_chart`: a point `{"x": "Mon", "y": "5"}` (wrong type); a point `{"x": "Mon"}` (missing `y`); a point `{"x": "Mon", "y": 5, "label": "a"}` (extra field).
  - `pie_chart`: a slice `{"label": "A", "value": "12"}` (wrong type); a slice `{"value": 12}` (missing `label`); a slice `{"label": "A", "value": 12, "color": "red"}` (extra field).
  - `heatmap`: a row `{"x": "Mon", "y": "09:00", "value": "3"}` (wrong type); a row `{"x": "Mon", "value": 3}` (missing `y`); a row `{"x": "Mon", "y": "09:00", "value": 3, "color": "red"}` (extra field).
- [ ] Given each data widget type with data that meets its empty condition (`summary_card`, `ranked_list_card`, `progress_list_card`, `grid` and `heatmap` with `rows` [], `pie_chart` with `slices` [], `cartesian_chart` with `series` [] or only series with no points, and `metric_card` with a null `value`), when it renders, then the widget shows the localized "No data to show" inside its cell, and the cell frame stays.
- [ ] Given a `summary_card` and a `grid` each showing the number 1234.5, when `value_format` is absent or `value_type` is `number`, then both show 1,234.5 for host language English. When `value_type` is `percent` and the value is 0.25, then both show 25%. When `value_type` is `duration` with `unit` `s` and the value is 90, then both show 90 with the localized unit for seconds, not converted to another unit. The same formatting applies to the values of `metric_card`, `ranked_list_card`, `progress_list_card`, the chart tooltips and text alternatives, and the heatmap scale and cell values.
- [ ] Given a `cartesian_chart`, a `pie_chart`, and a `heatmap`, when they are inspected with assistive technology, then each has a localized accessible name and a text alternative that lists the delivered values (series, x and y; slice labels and values; heatmap x, y and values).
- [ ] Given the reference dashboard, when a keyboard-only walkthrough covers all 9 widget types in their cells in the light and in the dark theme, then every widget passes the host's accessibility checks (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-accessibility`).
- [ ] Given the reference dashboard, when a screen-reader walkthrough covers all 9 widget types in their cells and in the larger view, in the light and in the dark theme, then every control announces its name, role and state, each widget's empty and own cannot-be-shown states are read as text, the charts and the heatmap read their accessible name and text alternative, and every widget passes the host's accessibility checks (`cpt-frontx-dashboard-nfr-accessibility`).
- [ ] Given the dashboard-author guide, when it is reviewed, then it covers writing a dashboard JSON, the grid, the binding, the catalog, the layout checks, that the product owns dashboard and data size, that every viewer who may see a dashboard must be able to get its widgets' data, that the product's API owns errors and access, what the host must provide, and the documented limitations (the limitations of PRD §6.3 and the DESIGN limits of DESIGN §5). When a dashboard author who did not build the template and has not used it before follows the guide alone, then they write a first working dashboard in one working session.
